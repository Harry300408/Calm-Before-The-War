  startup.1.desc:0 "Welcome to Calm Before the War which is a mod about what if the Central Powers won the Eurasien-Krieg, the UK joined the Central Powers which swayed the war in the Central Powers favour. \n\n7.11.2053 \nLOG 1:"Jürgen glad to so you today, you do know what day it is today. right?" \n"no, i don't know what day it is today" \n"Well today is Friday and you know what that means, it's time to go on a little time travel adventure."\n"So the machine is ready?" \n"It's been ready for months, we just didn't think you were ready."\nI was taken through the door into the hallway, then was taken right down to the end of the hallway, and then through a doorway into a changing room. They told me to change into the clothing that was on the bench infront of me and that was what i did. I knocked on the door and it opened up, a man with a scientific coat walked into the room and told me to sit down, so i sat down and he pulled a chair from a cross the room and sat down on it. \n"I'm trusting you with this" he rummaged  around in his right pocket and took out a voice recorder and passed it to me. He also told me "Just before you are in the pod we will give you a Prussian rifle from the 1830s, specifically the M-1862 Dreyse needle-gun. You may be thinking why are you giving me a rifle from the 1830s. We are giving this to you as we are sending you to 1830's Prussia to see all the Victorian Era events in a personal perspective. This is the reason why we gave you the voice recorder, so you don't forget anything. Please try not to mess anything up as you know the consequences, the world you come back to may not be totally the same it may not be anything like this at all." \n"I understand, there is one more question i have." \n"Yes?" \n"Where will i be when i go back to the 1830's?" \n"You will be in 1830's Prussia of course." \n"No, not that i meant where. Like what area, state, city, or maybe even town?" \n"Thats a very good question, hopefully you'll find yourself in the forest outside of Brandenburg. Make Sure to hide your pod in the dirt or behind some rocks so the people of Brandenburg don't get a whiff of suspicion."\n"Ok, thanks for letting me know." \nThe man looked at the clock he saw that it was almost time for the operation to begin. He told to get up and that the guards would escort me down the hallway into the Zeitraum (Time Room) "Don't forget your helmet otherwise it'll be a very bumpy ride *under his breath* not that it already is"\n"What was that?" \n"Nothing""

  startup.3.desc:0 "After both the Eurasien-Krieg and the Anglo-Turk War the Kingdom of Britain & Ireland decended into political chaos, There was mass riots in the streets as the people of Britain were fed up with the amount of wars the Tory (Conservitave) Party were involved in or started. During the riots a group of Middle Class men led by Harry Pollitt formed the Peoples Party also known as the SPGB (Syndical Party of Great Britain) and Oswald Moesly forming the BUF (British Union of Facists). With the current power vacuum in the UK King Geroge V had to step in and take control of the country while the riots were happening. The riots almost escaleted into a full blown civil war between the Democratic parties and the "Extreme Parties". King George stormed parliment and oversaw parliment until the elections of 1934, which was an election to see who the people thought could best lead the UK to glory. The people chose Moesly and the BUF to lead the UK which gave him the power to expel the other two governments and set up a dictatorship with him at the center and his advisory board to help with Economics, Forign Relations and Military Opperations. \n\nThe SPGB\nThe SPGB still works in secret, working on uniting the people of Britain agaisnts the Herald Oswald Moesly. With increasing support for the Syndicals the Communists in France would want to intervene to replace the Syndicals with a Cooperative Marxist-Communist Party.\n\nWhat Happened To The Demmocrats?:\nWhen the Tory and Labor parties were expelled from the British government the Tories loyalist's fled to Lower Raj and the Labour loyalist's fled to British Cape of Good Hope.\nWhen the Tories took control of Lower Raj, Herald Moesly was outraged but had to leave them in fear of riots. But when the Labour loyalist's seized control of the Cape Colony the Herald had to take action but it was justifed by Moesly saying they were working with the SPGB, using resources to supply the Syndicals and working on gaining Syndical support in the Cape.\nHowever the people of Britain did not like this but brushed it to the side as it was a quick war as the Labour Loyalist's were underprepared and did not expect an invasion. When the Labour Loyalist's were deafeted the people of Britain rejoiced as they're opposition were crushed and a loyal Colonial Government was put in charge"
